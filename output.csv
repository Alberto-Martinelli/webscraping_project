Andrew Carmellini worked with me at Caf√© Boulud for many years and is an excellent chef., My Grandmother's Ravioli: This is some serious ravioli. It‚Äôs stuffed with beef, veal and pork, topped with a thick, zesty sauce and a sprinkling of cheese. Lovers of light, airy pasta need not apply., The food here is exceptional, compared to some of the other restaurants that have more than one Michelin star this one is far better. Excellent wine selection with sommelier! Ravioli to die for! Yum!, Lovely to sit outside. Ricotta app and duck sausage pasta great! Mushroom one also better (had small bite!), A tad scene-y and food can be mixed. However, for solid brunch fare, start with the sheep‚Äôs milk ricotta with truffle honey ($15) and move to the uovo modenese with cotechino hash ($20)., Really enjoyed the Malfadine Verde, the unique texture of the pasta complements the white veal  bolognese. I would totally come back for it!, The food, quite simply, is just delicious. The complimentary focaccia is divine. Try the paccheri pasta with the lamb sliders. The riccota crostini dish is very lush too. Buy a bottle or two of wine!, A perfectly balanced interior, is upscale yet approachable with wonderful service and a strong showing in food. Ricotta, Ravioli, and the Rice Pudding are all winners., Sheep's milk ricotta and the meatball sliders were fantastic, but the spaghetti alla chitarra was too overpowered by the seafood taste and the paccheri was a little too al dente. Nice wine selection!, We ordered burrata, lamb meatball, pasta(tonnarelli cacio e pepe) and scallops; food was amazing and service was on point. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
